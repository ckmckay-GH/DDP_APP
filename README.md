# DDP_APP
This repo contains my Coursera Developing Data Products Course Project

The App was built using r Shiny 
The App predicts a car's 1/4 mils time in seconds based on car weight and horsepower

The mtcars dataset was used to develop the regression model used to predict the 1/4 mile time

A Plotly 3D scatter shart displays the cars in the mtcars dataset and the highlighted point 
for the "new" car uased onm user input weight and horse power
